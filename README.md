# Honeypot #
Do you like entrapment? I know I do. 

This tool is used to keep a server running that, if accessed, will send you a [pushover](https://pushover.net) notification.

Put a link to it in your toolbar and catch privacy hating friends left and right.

***Who could resist it?***

Use it as a ficticious image host for an invisible pixel for your admin view, and *boom*: reusable honeypot.

## How to get started ##
Add your pushover information in lib/push.js
  $ node index.js
Visit http://localhost:8099
